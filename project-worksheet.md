## Project Description

This project is a personal portfolio website which will highlight other apps, projects, and websites that I have designed. It will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and any additional libraries such as bootstrap that may provide useful resources. My intention is to create a site that is Responsive, Dynamic, and Intuitive to navigate. To that end not only will it be built with a Mobile First design, but will also utilize dynamic transitions as the user scrolls through the site, helping it come to life.
